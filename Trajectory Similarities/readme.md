# Trajectory Similarity

The pdf document is downloaded from https://github.com/yaodi833/traj_similarity. I find this document on https://www.zhihu.com/question/27213170/answer/271567963, thanks YaoDi very much.

In this document, some algorithms to measure the similarity between two trajectories are given. 

On another web link https://www.zhihu.com/question/52953107/answer/454427952, another toolkit was given in stevenliuyi's replay. He also post the source code on https://github.com/stevenliuyi/china-district-shapes/blob/master/china-district-shapes.ipynb. Thanks stevenliuyi too.
