This is the source code of pierre-rouanet's dtw 1.4 on GitHub 1 year ago.
I rewrite some codes and add many comments to help myself to understand the codes.
As sklearn.metrics changes it's parameters, I rewrite those parts too.

The origin code can be found at https://github.com/pierre-rouanet/dtw/blob/master/dtw/dtw.py.
