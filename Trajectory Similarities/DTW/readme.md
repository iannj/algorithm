# Dynamic Time Warping

Dynamic Time Warping (shortcut as DTM) algorithm is used to compare the similarity between two sequences. While Euclidean Distance can only describe the distance between two sequences with same length, DTW can calculate the distance between two sequences with different length, using Manhattan Distance, Euclidean Distance or some other distance algorithms.
