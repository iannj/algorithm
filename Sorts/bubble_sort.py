"""Bubble Sort Algorithm:
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
This function is the implementation of Bubble Sort Algorithm in python. In this function, a variable swapped is defined. If no elements are swapped, which means that all elements are in order. a break command will stop the looping as soon as possible.
